"problem i'm hoping to be able to provide a streamlit function that allows for the downloading of files. there are a few solutions in the wild at the moment that i know of, each with its own downsides: doesn't work on since this requires mutation of a write protected streamlit python package directory. doesn't work for files larger than 50 mb, requires the time cost of converting to base64 and having that be written onto the html page. won't work on since it requires a separate server. won't work on since it requires editing streamlit before the server boots.solutionapi details *`str``str` or `bytes` or `file``str``str` or `none``str`*) returns true if the button was clicked on the last run of the app. false otherwise.return type `bool`example usage implementationtldr - extend the button widget with download capabilities - use the mediafilemanager to store the file for downloading.plan implementation of the download button requires two parts: - implement the proto/frontend button widget to accept a download url and file name and download the url specified. - implementing the api on the python side to create a button. essentially, this will be very similar code to `st.button`, but it must do a few things differently: - store the file information somewhere on the server - instruct the frontend that it's a download button as well as a url to download the button from. - proper clean up of the file information on rerun.tasks can be done in the following order to be done in the mainline `develop` branch with no issues. overall, i see 2-3 tasks: - [ ] implement the proto/frontend to test for a download button. - extend the proto with a `downloadfilename` default the python button to set that equal to `none` - extend the same to include the added feature for download url. if it exists, download the url by creating a shadow link. see the . - unit tests for the button with the new functionality. - verification of e2e tests that standard buttons are unchanged. - [ ] implement the python api - api meets spec. - properly documented and approved by documentation. - add file bytes to a location themediafilemanager - this begins to break the paradigm of the mediafilemanager (focus on media), but routes are provided and there's no real reason why it focuses on media. it's more or less a file type. a task to \"generalize\" mediafilemanager to be filemanager can be created and done beforehand or done if the amount of work is small. - full e2e tests for the download button possible.", "labels": "other"}, {"number": 491, "html_url":

some help. needless to say, i've already read all the issues regarding the tk1 (mainly and ). in both of the following situations, i've managed to reproduce the error by trying to compile a single .cu (openpose/src/openpose/core/resizeandmergebase.cu, but tested with others with same outcome) from openpose through command line (with a nvcc command and its corresponding flags/paths). this is what i'll be posting, but take into account that the same error appears when i launch \"make all\" in my openpose build, but this is much more readable imho also, i've been able to compile natively in both a vm ubuntu 14.04x64, so i have some knowledge of the openpose environment. in both scenarios, compilation went flawlessly but in the vm it never launched since vms do not offer cuda support. for this process of trying to compile i've followed 2 ways with different errors: native compilation and cross-compilation. native complation testing native compilation in the tk1. i could install all the dependencies with apt-get and got caffe compiled as well. but when nvcc in openpose comes to play... error. this was the command tested $ /usr/local/cuda-6.5/bin/nvcc

i've tried \\n but i assume that's only for print related arguments... but i'm fairly new to python so excuse my ignorance. on top of this, how could i improve the voice in colab? in regards to training, it's mentioned that a decent session requires around 500gb or more... since i don't exactly have that in colab, is there another way to go about doing this? i've tried the code with the input being longer than 10 seconds, but apparently if the input is more than 10 seconds or so the voice seems more jittery than it would be if it were capped at 10 seconds. i absolutely applaud this repo but i just really need to understand it a bit better... thanks in advance.", "labels": "question"}, {"number": 1239, "html_url": "https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/issues/1239", "title": "Is it possible train models in windows?", "description": "i don't have linux and want to run this code in windows with gpu. is it possible to run it or do i have to change something?", "labels": "question"}, {"number": 391, "html_url": "https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/issues/391", "title": "bad results with custom model", "description": "i have trained a none-resnet-bilstm-ctc which return great results (as 90%) in the original repo but here, i get really bad recognition", "labels": "question"}, {"number": 28, "html_url": "https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/issues/28", "title": "Viewing loss plot of previous result", "description": "sorry if these questions are very basic; i am a student and new to this. is there a way to retrieve the loss plot or final training accuracy of previous runs?
