"description during an effort to reduce memory footprint by splitting input files in chunks of 30 seconds, discussed on we noticed that spleeter is adding a tiny padding after each output stem file, what makes a small gap when stitching back the 30's chunks in one single stem. sometimes this gap can be unnoticeable, but when processing a song and mixing it back, it is easy to spot the hiccup in the song. also, after analyzing the waveform, it's clear that a gap is added by spleeter: in order to make sure it is related to spleeter, i've tried separating and stitching other files not processed via spleeter and the stitching was flawless. during the entire experiment, i've used only lossless(wav) files to avoid issues with padding that some lossy files would cause. is the file that generated the waveform above, you can notice a hiccup (gap) every 30 seconds when listening carefully. step to reproduce 1 - use an example wav file that has more than 30 seconds and split it into 30s chunks using ffmpeg or sox. you can rename your file to myfile.wav to reuse the code below: ffmpeg: `ffmpeg -i myfile.wav -f segment -segment_time 30 -c copy myfile-%03d.wav` sox: `sox myfile.wav myfile-.wav trim 0 30 : newfile : restart` 2 - process all the chunks using spleeter: `spleeter separate -i myfile-.wav; do echo \"file '$pwd/$f'\"; done) -c copy output.wav` sox: `sox accompaniment.wav accompaniment2.wav output.wav` 5 - listen to output.wav and notice the hiccup during the transition at ~30s. you can also use this by @amo13 environment -----------------

`args.restoreofmodel.pth.tar` so it's easy to use the models in synthesis by providing just the path name. this can be mitigated by creating a symbolic link in the experiment folder

and my dev experience, i'm new to using streamlit, and recently, i made as the solution to an assignment for my current course, \"artificial intelligence\". if you're interested in checking out the code, you can . other than that, i have used voila, matplotlib, seaborn, and pyplot for visualizations. recently, i've been working on a research paper, and for that, i had to develop a questionnaire using google forms. the research basically aims at gathering data about their opinions, beliefs, academic/situational/learning factors that have affected their semester progression throughout the university. i have gotten plenty of data from the university's students, which i believe is immensely interesting. now i wish that i can easily share their results with other students in my university to show the impact that online education has influenced learning capabilities. google forms does give you access to see all the responses and the fancy graphs they make, but you can't make that public. you can also download all of that data as a .csv file, and i immediately thought of streamlit, \"man, i wish i can just give this csv file to a streamlit application, tell it the format is from google forms, and then ask streamlit to generate graphs similar to the graphs that google forms generates, and then share a link with everyone - maybe even more kinds of graphs!\" unfortunately, i do not have enough time to write code from scratch for a streamlit application and put it into production right now, and i also do not know of other technologies which can potentially do this. maybe a potential solution is either powerbi or tableau, but i have no experience with them, and neither do i know of any easy way of putting an online web application that shows all these statistics. in my opinion, google forms itself has an option, but being frankly honest, i find google forms to be visually very unappealing. its ui looks outdated and makes filling forms a very boring experience. there is always `surveymonkey`, and `typeform`, but they aren't as free out of the box as google forms is. i don't think anyone sharing google form response results will appeal to anyone but a few executives or managers wanting to understand the data in whatever way.solution ** if you don't like the mvp above, tell us why, and what you'd like done instead. you need somewhere to deploy to show

and promising results with other languages. i am doing now training on 11 hours 1 speaker russian dataset and the training has already reached 40000 global steps. it was expected (by me) that by that stage the tts will be able to produce somewhat speech-like or at least something from what could be said - it is training well. but what i have instead is some strange noise while testing, which changes with different text provided, but seems like changes randomly. what is more interesting, checking on the tensorboard on-fly samples makes me confused. evalaudios sometimes are ok, but sometimes have some non-speech noises, a lot of them. if check the trainaudios - they are usually ends with a terrible screamer-like loud noises which take about half durations. it seems like on their spot must be a silence. if the tts is learning on those files, obviously, it can hardly learn. the dataset has various samples with duration from 0.5 to 38.5 second with the majority on around 5 secs.

slider to other values and then came back a few times: --- i had a suspicion that this might be due to the new garbage collection process being undergone in `0.82.0`: so i downgraded to version

would not only be able to embed into a streamlit app, but also inject your own data from python into the observable notebook, and use the observable notebook as a widget in the streamlit app. problem - as a user, i want to use custom elements that i could only currently do with `unsafehtml`. - as a user, i want the option to have complete control of the charts and graphics in my streamlit app, outside of the current builtin charts and integrations. - (stretch) as a user, i want to be able to create my own custom widgets (forms, sliders, pickers, etc.) with my own interactions and user interface.solution (quick observable notebook review - every notebook is composed of cells, and each cell either has a unique name or is anonymous. the cells are and executed only when needed) with this proposal, there will be 3 main use cases for embedding observable notebooks in a streamlit app: 1. embedding plain observable notebooks with no modifications ** - allow users to and use it in python - with any inputs and custom css - - for color pickers, map coordinates pickers, local file chooser, passwords, etc.potential code samples `st.observable` definition things to consider (security, required setup, etc.) - since observable notebooks are basically just running arbitrary javascript, each notebook embedding should be in an iframe. this won't solve all security problems, but it'll at least sandbox the notebook away from the streamlit window/dom. - the iframe should ideally have a different origin, for security purposes. maybe streamlit could invest in a domain like `` (that could be configured to a self hosted option, like `st.observable(\"@/b\", iframechart` where it can be later re-defined to another streamlit element, like this: but, if we want to be able to observe values of an embed notebook, then it also makes sense for it to act like a widget like `slider` or `textchart` or `text`, but can also be a streamlit widget like `slider` or `text_input`. resources - from observablehq - from me - from me - defining how a host can create and interact with an observable notebook in an iframe (wip) - from me, implementation of the above protocol (also a wip). something like this would have to be built in `/frontend` --- note: this is something i'd love to work on! i've made a lot of tooling/packages around observable notebooks, and i'd love better

restructuring of the codebase. i am opening this as an issue to promote discussion relating to the current face extraction algorithm and whether it is indeed sufficient. i, however, am still planning

performance on another platform (raspberrypi+coral tpu). i know it is not your party, but i'm really baffled by the quality of your work, tutorials and documentation and i thought you could provide me some input from your experience, if you like. since i was not able to follow successfully the google tutorial ( for transfer learning on object detection, i thought probably this could work: 1) the aim is to re-train a mobilenet ssd v1 or v2 model for 90 classes to be fit for 4 classes only (person, car, roadsign, bicycle) and run it on a coral tpu with the same performance i get from a jetson nano with deepstream. right now i'm achieving 30 fps inference rate at 640x480 for three usb cameras simultaneously on the nano, 30 fps for each cam. i'm only able to achieve 10 fps per cam with the rpi/coral tuple. i would like to improve that at least by factor 3. i'm sure, using a class-reduced model would definitely help. 2) so i thought i could follow one of your tutorials first and either re-train an existing model with a sub-dataset or create a new model from scratch with own imagery and annotations. you have provided very nice videos and documentations for that, it shouldn't be too problematic to come to first results with that. that would allow me to run the training on the jetson gpu and - as far as i hope - i could also use the resulting model together with the deepstream sdk (?) on the nano for comparison and tests. 3) then it would be awesome to make this model \"google tpu ready\". as far as i understood you are in a first step converting torch to onxx, while i would need a tflite model from the torch output, which then would need to be compiled by the edgetpu compiler to an edgetpu.tflite model. i thought i could use maybe this repo in order to make the conversion from torch to tflite i have not started any of these adventures. i was just checking, if this path is promising. may i ask you for your opinion on that? i hope it is not too blasphemic to ask for google on a jetson project. kind regards", "labels": "other"}, {"number": 1057, "html_url": "https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/issues/1057", "title": "Is possibile to train the

(...) for the datasets of the synthesizer and the vocoder, transcripts are required and the quality of the generated audio can only be as good as that of the data. higher quality and annotated datasets are thus required, which often means they are smaller in size. you'll need two datasets: the second one needs audio transcripts and high quality audio. here, finetuning won't be as effective as for the encoder, but you can get away with less data (300-500 hours). you will likely not have the alignments for that dataset, so you'll have to adapt the preprocessing procedure of the synthesizer to not split audio on silences. see the code and you'll understand what i mean. don't start training the encoder if you don't have a dataset for the synthesizer/vocoder, you won't be able to do anything then. _originally posted by @corentinj in", "labels": "other"}, {"number": 547, "html_url": "https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/issues/547", "title": "minor bug when migrating from 1.4 to 1.4.1.
