These models are characterized by their enormous size, typically measured in billions of parameters, which allows them to capture complex patterns and nuances in natural language.\\n\\nOne key aspect of these models is their ability to perform a wide range of tasks without being specifically programmed for each one. This versatility comes from their training process, where they learn from diverse datasets that include books, articles, websites, and more. As a result, they can generate text, answer questions, translate languages, write stories, and even provide explanations or summaries of topics.\\n\\nHowever, large language models also come with challenges, such as ensuring the accuracy and fairness of their outputs, managing computational resources required for their operation, and addressing privacy concerns related to the data used in their training.\\n\\nOverall, large language models represent a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence and continue to push the boundaries of what machines can do in understanding and generating human language.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **For Each Round**:  \n",
    "   - Classify the round into one of the five categories: **error**, **performance**, **deployment**, **question**, or **other**.  \n",
    "   - Provide a JSON object with keys `round`, `classification`, `evidence`, and `self_reflection`.  \n",
    "     - **round**: The round number.  \n",
    "     - **classification**: Your chosen classification for that round.  \n",
    "     - **evidence**: Direct quotes or references from that specific round’s conversation that support your classification.  \n",
    "     - **self_reflection**: Justify your classification’s accuracy. Confirm whether it matches the repository’s description and consider alternatives. If unsure, reflect on the possibility of user misunderstanding vs. repository code issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Self-Reflection Across Rounds**:  \n",
    "   - After classifying all rounds, review the entire conversation and your intermediate classifications.  \n",
    "   - Check for consistency:  \n",
    "     - Does the chosen final category align with the majority of evidence and the repository description?  \n",
    "     - Are there any contradictions between rounds?  \n",
    "     - Could the issue be a misunderstanding (question) rather than a repository problem (error/performance/deployment)?  \n",
    "     - If the issue is irrelevant to the repository description, finalize as **other**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Finalize the Classification**:  \n",
    "   Produce a final JSON object containing:  \n",
    "   - `final_issue_type`: Your chosen final category.  \n",
    "   - `combined_evidence`: A concise summary of the entire conversation supporting your final classification.  \n",
    "   - `final_self_reflection`: Analysis of the reasoning process, conflicts, and how you ensured consistency with the repository description and instructions.\n",
